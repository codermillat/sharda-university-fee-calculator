# Push Latest Fixes and Deploy

## What Was Fixed (Commit 1149c4e)
✅ Removed `@google/genai` reference from HTML import map
✅ Removed unused CSS link reference

## Push to GitHub

Run this command:

```bash
cd /Users/mdmillathosen/Desktop/sharda-university-fee-calculator
git push origin main
```

## After Pushing

1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for GitHub Actions to build and deploy
2. Go to: https://github.com/codermillat/sharda-university-fee-calculator/actions
3. Wait for the green checkmark ✅
4. Visit: https://codermillat.github.io/sharda-university-fee-calculator/
5. **Hard refresh** the page: `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

## If Still Blank

### Check Browser Console
1. Open Developer Tools: `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac) or `F12` (Windows)
2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Look for any errors (red text)
4. Share the errors if you see any

### Check Network Tab
1. In Developer Tools, go to **Network** tab
2. Refresh the page
3. Look for any failed requests (red)
4. Check if `index-CdEX1HO6.js` loads successfully

### Potential Issues

**Issue 1: Browser Cache**
- Solution: Hard refresh or clear cache

**Issue 2: Assets not loading from correct path**
- The JS should load from: `/sharda-university-fee-calculator/assets/index-CdEX1HO6.js`
- Check Network tab to verify

**Issue 3: React not loading**
- Check if `https://aistudiocdn.com/react@^19.2.0` loads
- Check console for JavaScript errors

## Alternative: Deploy to Vercel

If GitHub Pages continues to have issues, Vercel is simpler:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click **New Project**
4. Import: `codermillat/sharda-university-fee-calculator`
5. Click **Deploy**

Vercel advantages:
- No base path configuration needed
- Faster deployments
- Better error messages
- Works immediately

Your Vercel URL will be: `https://sharda-university-fee-calculator.vercel.app`
