## The Problem
Your GitHub Actions workflow failed because **GitHub Pages is not enabled yet** in your repository settings.

## The Solution (2 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (1 minute)

1. Go to: https://github.com/codermillat/sharda-university-fee-calculator/settings/pages
2. Under **"Build and deployment"** â†’ **"Source"**
3. Select **"GitHub Actions"** from the dropdown
4. That's it! (No need to click save, it auto-saves)

### Step 2: Push the Fixed Workflow

I've already committed the fixes locally. Just push them:

```bash
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Use Vercel Instead (Recommended!)

Honestly, Vercel is much easier for React apps:

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select `codermillat/sharda-university-fee-calculator`
5. Click Deploy

Done in 2 minutes! Plus you get:
- Faster deployments
- Better performance  
- Automatic HTTPS
- Custom domains
- Preview deployments

Your Vercel URL will be something like:
**https://sharda-university-fee-calculator.vercel.app**
