# Fix for Blank Page on GitHub Pages

## Problem
The page at https://codermillat.github.io/sharda-university-fee-calculator/ was showing blank because the `base` path in Vite config was incorrect.

## Solution Applied
Updated `vite.config.ts` to use the correct base path for GitHub Pages:
- **Production (GitHub Pages)**: `/sharda-university-fee-calculator/`
- **Development (Local)**: `/`

## What I Did
âœ… Fixed the `base` path in `vite.config.ts`
âœ… Rebuilt the project successfully
âœ… Committed the changes (commit `4b24636`)

## Next Step: Push to GitHub

Run this command to push the fix:

```bash
cd /Users/mdmillathosen/Desktop/sharda-university-fee-calculator
git push origin main
```

Then:
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Actions to rebuild and deploy
2. Refresh https://codermillat.github.io/sharda-university-fee-calculator/
3. The page should now load correctly! âœ…

## Why This Happened

GitHub Pages serves your site at `username.github.io/repository-name/`, so Vite needs to know the base path to correctly reference all assets (JS, CSS, images).

The fix ensures:
- CSS loads from: `/sharda-university-fee-calculator/assets/index.css`
- JS loads from: `/sharda-university-fee-calculator/assets/index.js`
- Logo loads from: `/sharda-university-fee-calculator/logo.png`

Instead of trying to load from the root (`/assets/...`) which would fail.

## Verification

Once deployed, you should see:
- The calculator interface
- Sharda University logo in the header
- Working dropdowns and inputs
- Fee calculations displaying correctly

## If Still Blank

If the page is still blank after deployment:
1. Hard refresh: `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check the browser console (F12) for any errors
4. Wait another minute - sometimes GitHub Pages takes 2-3 minutes to fully update

**Status**: Fix ready, just needs to be pushed to GitHub! ðŸš€
